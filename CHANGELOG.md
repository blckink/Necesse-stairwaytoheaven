## [0.1.0] — "First Ascent" — 2026-08-22

First playable release. Built and integration-tested against Necesse **1.3.2**.

### Added
- **The Skyreach**: persistent one-world sky dimension (`skyreach`, dimension `+1`),
  infinite and region-streamed like the cave layers, with a per-world seed derived from
  the world seed.
- **Stairway to Heaven** object pair: craftable surface stairway (Tungsten Workstation,
  8 Tungsten Bars + 15 Quartz — deliberately gated alongside the Deep Cave Ladder) and
  the auto-placed sky-side return stairway; both ride the vanilla ladder/portal netcode.
  Ascending onto the Mistsea forms a Cloudturf landing instead of vanilla's dirt fill.
- **Sub-biomes** painted into the biome layer: Driftlands (common), Stormveil
  (uncommon), Aurora Shoals (rare) — each with its own spawn table and object set.
- **Tiles**: Cloudturf (organic), Skystone, Stormslate, and the swimmable Mistsea
  liquid; placing tiles over the Mistsea reclaims Cloudturf.
- **Objects**: Skystone Rock, Aetherium Rock (ore), Storm Crystal and Aurora Bloom
  (2×1 glowing clusters), Sky Reeds.
- **Enemies** (Tungsten-era tuning): Zephyr Ray (220 HP melee flier), Storm Wisp
  (280 HP ranged, spark bolts), Skystone Golem (520 HP armored bruiser). All spawn in
  daylight via raised spawn-light thresholds.
- **Items**: Skystone, Aetherium Ore/Bar, Storm Shard, Windsilk, Aurora Petal;
  **Tempest Edge** (sword, 68 dmg/290 ms) and **Galehowl** (bow, 62 dmg/480 ms,
  +10% arrow velocity) as Tungsten-tier sidegrades, with recipes and loot tables.
- **Localization**: English and German.
- **`skyreachstatus`** admin command: world-gen statistics + placement diagnostics for
  bug reports and automated testing.
- **Asset pipeline**: deterministic Python/Pillow generator producing all 34 textures in
  vanilla sheet formats (`tools/asset_generator/`).
- **Headless integration test** (`scripts/integration_test.sh`): boots the official
  dedicated server with the mod, generates a world, drives `skyreachstatus` via the
  console and asserts clean logs + expected generation.
- Documentation set: DESIGN, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, asset style guide, and a
  `docs/research/` knowledge base (verified engine notes: modding API, registration
  APIs, asset formats, community patterns, progression reference).

### Changed
- Build modernized to Gradle 8.10 (runs on current JDKs; still emits Java 8 bytecode via
  `options.release`). Added `NECESSE_GAME_DIR` env override and dedicated-server
  (`Server.jar`) fallback so CI/headless environments can build without a Steam install.

### Fixed (during pre-release testing, caught by the integration test)
- Startup crash: `materials.ores` is not a vanilla item category — Aetherium Ore now
  registers under `materials.ore`.
- Storm Crystals/Aurora Blooms vanished at world-gen: crystal clusters are 2×1
  multi-tile objects; the painter now writes both halves and reserves the partner tile.
- All natural sky decor vanished at world-gen: freshly generated islands report
  `isShore` everywhere until the liquid height map settles; sky decor now sets
  `canPlaceOnShore`.
- Sky Reeds refused to generate: Cloudturf is now flagged organic soil.
- Skyreach terrain was identical in every world: the lazy level-creation path passes no
  seed; the level now derives its seed from the persisted world seed.
