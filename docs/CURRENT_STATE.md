# Current state

Short, current, and rewritten as things change. History belongs in
`CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/PLAYTEST_LOG.md`, not here.

**Version:** 0.5.0 (v0.6 visual sprint unreleased) · **Game:** Necesse 1.3.2 ·
**Branch:** `master`
**Updated:** 2026-08-25, v0.6 visual production sprint

## Architecture in one screen

Two extra dimensions registered through
`LevelIdentifier.IDENTIFIER_TO_DIMENSION`: **Skyreach** (`skyreach`, +1) and
**The Veil** (`veil`, −3). Both are `BiomeGeneratorStackLevel`s that stream
regions, so they are effectively infinite and generate lazily.

The **Stairway is a portal**. Wherever it is built on the Surface it routes to
one canonical Skyreach origin computed from the world-generation seed
(`worldgen/SkyOrigin`), where the Old Warden Spire stands. Terrain radiates
from that origin: the hub is clamped to walkable land, and ore density widens
with distance band. The return gate resolves each player's own bound stairway
from `quest/SkywatchQuestData`, which persists per-player bindings.

The **Warden** is the progression NPC. Meeting him completes the find-the-spire
quest; paying 100,000 coins recruits him, which places a real `HumanShop`
settler (`mobs/WardenSettlerMob`, registered as settler type
`settlement/WardenSettler`) on the Surface at the player's stairway and hands
over the Silver Bell.

Assets are **generated, not hand-drawn**: `tools/asset_generator/` writes every
PNG in `src/main/resources/`. Editing a PNG directly is always wrong.

## Green — verified working

- Mod loads on a dedicated server; Skyreach and Veil generate; no log errors.
- World survives a server restart: spire returns at identical coordinates,
  Warden and both cats still present (asserted every test run).
- Warden settler registration resolves (`/skyreachstatus` reports
  `wardensettler=WardenSettler`).
- Siggi and Peanut are unkillable and save-persistent by native means.
- `python3 tools/size_audit.py` reports 0 flags.
- Marble Checker floor no longer crashes clients (`ca2ddad`); `scripts/tile_sprite_check.sh`
  proves it headlessly.
- `python3 tools/locale_audit.py` reports 77 registered IDs all named in both
  locales.
- v0.6 sprint gates (2026-08-25): generator output byte-identical on
  regeneration, `buildModJar` builds, `scripts/integration_test.sh` passes on
  this Mac against the Downloads dedicated-server install.

## v0.6 visual sprint — shipped, NOT yet player-confirmed

Everything below regenerated through the pipeline and inspected on contact
sheets (`build/qa/`, `build/sprite-gallery.html`); no human has seen it in
game yet.

- **Rock family**: 8 Skystone / 6 Veilrock variants with real geological
  characters (slab, strata, boulder domes, fracture, split, rubble, pits,
  terrace), carved irregular perimeters, base-dominant face fills, and the
  vanilla soft-alpha ground skirt instead of the old dark band.
- **Storm Shards**: complete redesign — 4 asymmetric 64px cluster formations
  of tilted, overlapping, value-alternating crystal blades on a shared rubble
  bed; deep violet planes, restrained pale edges.
- **Tree volume pass**: shared `_canopy_volume` (overlap shadows between
  lobes/tiers, one global light field, sheen demotion on the shadow side,
  trunk collar) applied to Nimbus Willow, Prismabirch, Fulgur Pine. Size and
  silhouettes untouched.
- **Cloudberry bush**: rebuilt as a dense leaf-clump dome (~30x20) with woody
  stems and sunk amber berry clusters; greener leaf ramp.
- **Warden**: storm-blue coat ramp (matches the settler's pinned livery),
  hood-down cowl behind the hair, brass collar clasp, weathered mend patches,
  cheek lines. Mob renderer and the HumanShop settler renderer untouched.
- **Spire hero kit**: beacon rebuilt as observatory machinery (sigil plinth,
  banded pillar with a snapped armature, brass yoke, faceted storm lens);
  new `skywatchtelescope` and `skywatchastrolabe` hero accents.
- **Stormveil prop families**: `stormscreed`, `skywatchrubble`,
  `chargecrystal` (lit), `withershrub` — craftable, worldgen-composable later.
- **Aurora accents**: `aurorashards` (lit), `starfall` (lit).
- **Sky oddity seeds** (registered + craftable, deliberately NOT in worldgen):
  `skyballoon`, `aeronautwreck`, `skyparcel`.

## Known issues — open

Ordered by the player's own priority. Full detail in `docs/PLAYTEST_LOG.md`.

**P1 — still open**
- Warden frequently stands facing north, so the player sees his back during
  the introduction. (Behaviour fix owned by another agent.)
- Warden's first dialogue dumps too much lore at once. (Another agent.)
- Old Warden Spire layout still reads as a small ordinary house — the asset
  kit is now strong enough (beacon, telescope, astrolabe, rubble), the layout
  itself is another agent's task.

**P1 — fixed, not yet player-confirmed**
- Rock/ore worldgen now uses a formation field (`7ef6486`).
- Aurora flora now grows in colonies (`7ef6486`).
- Galehound silhouette rebuilt (`080ea26`).
- Every registered object and tile has a display name, gated by
  `tools/locale_audit.py` (`eb76cb2`); all six tree and sapling item icons
  exist (`b90dc2a`).
- Harvest tools audited object-by-object against vanilla archetypes; flora,
  bones and wooden oddities no longer need the pickaxe (`a58e43b`, gated by
  the integration test's tool-audit assertions).
- Dewsnail is catchable with the net via the native `NetableMob` pattern
  (asserted by the integration test; not yet swung in the real client).
- v0.6 sprint (list above): rock variants + shadows, Storm Shards, tree
  volume, Cloudberry, Warden visuals, Spire hero kit, Stormveil/Aurora props,
  oddity seeds.

**P2**
- Tree canopy volume addressed by the v0.6 pass — awaiting player judgement
  (size and silhouettes were never touched).
- Cloudberry bush rebuilt in v0.6 — awaiting player judgement.
- Aurora plant placement was addressed by colonies (`7ef6486`); the new
  shard/starfall accents await player judgement.

- The Veil's ghost lantern object sprite is thin: its item icon carries 77
  opaque px against vanilla `copperstreetlamp`'s 240. The error icon is gone,
  but the sprite itself wants more mass.

**Deferred**
- Warden's shop is empty. The building set is fully craftable at a workstation,
  so nothing is missing — but the recruited Warden currently does nothing.
- Cat home / cat bed furniture and settled cat behaviour (post-playtest).
- Three journal quests are registered but never handed out (`swh_beacon`,
  `swh_cats`, `swh_anchor`).
- `ROADMAP.md` still describes the pre-v0.5 direction.
- Wiring the new Stormveil/Aurora prop families into `SkyTerrainPainter`
  (registered + craftable now; worldgen composition is a later, tuned pass).

## Last player-tested state

v0.5.0 build, played extensively in a real long-running Windows save on
2026-08-24. That session produced everything in `docs/PLAYTEST_LOG.md` under
that date, including the Marble Checker save-blocker. Nothing from the v0.6
sprint has been played yet.

## NOT player-verified

Do not describe any of these as working:

- everything in the v0.6 visual sprint list above
- Skystone Golem in game
- the complete Warden settlement lifecycle (recruit → move in → bed →
  happiness)
- cat progression after being brought home
- resource drops across the board
- outer-distance difficulty scaling
- travel/progression end to end
- building materials and custom floors other than Marble Checker
